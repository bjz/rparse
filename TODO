* Do a 0.2 release:
	- create a new branch for the release
	- update version (both in the crate and the readme)


* Talk about the theory and limitations.

* May want to package the exported items into rparse namespace. See #1238.
* Might want an example of parsing significant whitespace.
* Probably better to build as a static library, see #552.
* Would be nice if there was a way to localize messages:
	- maybe state could have a fn to map key strings to localized versions
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO (in all files)
	- make sure readme example works when using rparse
	- run unit tests in release
	- run unit tests in debug
	- review README
	- use git log --oneline > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- push changes
	- upload new source package
	- review the front page of the web site
	- update cargo, see bug 2266
	- create a new branch for the release
	- update version (both in the crate and the readme)
