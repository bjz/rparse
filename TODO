* Experiment with better logging:
	- see what xml example logging looks like
	- remove old logging
	- maybe err and note
		` info level on success
		` debug level on fail
	- use dedicated function(s) to log
		debug/dbg/note/annotate/log or info/debug/error
	- might want to log lit matching a debug
	- can we replace tag with something that also logs?
	- update examples
	- update readme
* Might want to replace list wih sepBy functions (see parsec3).
* Update web page
* Talk about info and debug logging.

* Would be more efficient to use char_range_at instead of converting the text to [char]
	- is this true given that we want to add EOT? could rely on the embedded null char
	- getting the col might be a little icky because that requires going backwards
* Talk about the theory and limitations.

* May want to package the exported items into rparse namespace. See #1238.
* Might want an example of parsing significant whitespace.
* Probably better to build as a static library, see #552.
* Would be nice if there was a way to localize messages:
	- maybe state could have a fn to map key strings to localized versions
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO (in all files)
	- make sure readme example works when using rparse
	- run unit tests in release
	- run unit tests in debug
	- review README
	- use git log --oneline > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- push changes
	- upload new source package
	- review the front page of the web site
	- update cargo, see bug 2266
	- create a new branch for the release
	- update version (both in the crate and the readme)
